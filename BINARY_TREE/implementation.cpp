// Node *buildTree(Node *root):  This code is a recursive function that builds a binary tree.

// The function takes a pointer to a Node as input, which represents the root of the current subtree. It prompts the user to enter a value for the current node, and reads it from the input using `cin`.

// If the value entered is -1, it means that there are no more nodes to be inserted in the current subtree, so the function returns `NULL` to indicate the end of the subtree.

// If the value entered is not -1, it creates a new Node with the entered value and assigns it to the `root` pointer. Then, it prompts the user to enter data for the left child of the current node and recursively calls the `buildTree` function to build the left subtree. Similarly, it prompts the user to enter data for the right child of the current node and recursively calls the `buildTree` function to build the right subtree.

// Finally, it returns the `root` pointer, which represents the root of the current subtree.






// void levelOrderTraversal(Node *root):  This code is implementing a level order traversal algorithm for a binary tree.

// The function `levelOrderTraversal` takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input.

// It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited.

// Initially, the root node is pushed into the queue.

// Then, a NULL marker is pushed into the queue to indicate the end of a level.

// The code enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.

// Inside the loop, the first node in the queue is removed and stored in the `temp` variable.

// If `temp` is NULL, it means that the end of a level has been reached. In this case, a new line is printed to separate the levels.

// If the queue is not empty, another NULL marker is pushed into the queue to indicate the end of the next level.

// If `temp` is not NULL, it means that a valid node has been dequeued. In this case, the data of the node is printed, followed by a space.

// If the node has a left child, it is pushed into the queue.

// If the node has a right child, it is also pushed into the queue.

// This process continues until all nodes in the binary tree have been visited.







// This code defines three functions: `inorder`, `preOrder`, and `postOrder`. Each function takes a pointer to a `Node` as its parameter.

// The `inorder` function performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree. It first checks if the `root` is `NULL`, which is the base case for the recursion. If the `root` is `NULL`, it means that there are no more nodes to process, so the function simply returns. Otherwise, it recursively calls `inorder` on the left subtree, then prints the data of the `root` node, and finally recursively calls `inorder` on the right subtree.

// The `preOrder` function performs a preorder traversal of a binary tree. It also checks if the `root` is `NULL` as the base case. If the `root` is `NULL`, it returns. Otherwise, it first prints the data of the `root` node, then recursively calls `preOrder` on the left subtree, and finally recursively calls `preOrder` on the right subtree.

// The `postOrder` function performs a postorder traversal of a binary tree. It follows the same structure as the other two functions, checking if the `root` is `NULL` as the base case. If the `root` is `NULL`, it returns. Otherwise, it first recursively calls `postOrder` on the left subtree, then recursively calls `postOrder` on the right subtree, and finally prints the data of the `root` node.

// In summary, these three functions traverse a binary tree in different orders: inorder, preorder, and postorder. Each function recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, and performs some operation (printing the data of the `root` node) at different points in the recursion.





// This code is a function called `buildFromLevelOrder` that builds a binary tree from level order traversal. 

// Here's how it works:

// 1. The function starts by creating an empty queue `q` and asks the user to enter the data for the root node.
// 2. It reads the input from the user and creates a new node with the entered data. This node becomes the root of the binary tree.
// 3. The root node is then pushed into the queue `q`.
// 4. The function enters a while loop that continues until the queue `q` is empty.
// 5. Inside the loop, the function takes the front element of the queue `q` and assigns it to a temporary node pointer `temp`.
// 6. The front element is then removed from the queue using the `pop` function.
// 7. The function asks the user to enter the data for the left child of the current node `temp`.
// 8. It reads the input from the user and checks if the entered data is not equal to -1.
// 9. If the entered data is not -1, it creates a new node with the entered data and assigns it as the left child of the current node `temp`.
// 10. The newly created left child node is then pushed into the queue `q`.
// 11. The function asks the user to enter the data for the right child of the current node `temp`.
// 12. It reads the input from the user and checks if the entered data is not equal to -1.
// 13. If the entered data is not -1, it creates a new node with the entered data and assigns it as the right child of the current node `temp`.
// 14. The newly created right child node is then pushed into the queue `q`.
// 15. The loop continues until all nodes in the level order traversal are processed.
// 16. Once the loop ends, the binary tree is successfully built from the level order traversal.
